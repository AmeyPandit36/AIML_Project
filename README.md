# Tree Species Classification
A good README.md file is crucial for any project, especially in data science and machine learning, as it helps others (and your future self!) understand what the project is about, how to use it, and its key features.

Here's a template for your "Tree Species Classification" project, with sections you can fill in and customize:

1. Introduction
This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model for the automated classification of different tree species from image data. Accurate tree species identification is vital for forestry management, ecological studies, biodiversity monitoring, and carbon sequestration efforts. This repository contains the code, models, and resources used for this classification task.

2. Problem Statement
Manually identifying tree species can be time-consuming, requires expert knowledge, and is prone to human error. With the increasing availability of high-resolution imagery (e.g., from drones, satellite, or ground-level photos), there's a significant opportunity to automate this process using computer vision and deep learning techniques. This project addresses the challenge of accurately classifying tree species based on visual features extracted from images.

3. Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Tree Species Identification Dataset" from Kaggle.
(If you're using a different dataset or have processed it significantly, update this section.)

Source: Kaggle

Description: This dataset comprises a collection of images categorized into various tree species. Each image typically represents a leaf, bark, or a full tree image of a specific species.

Structure:

/content/tree-species-dataset/Tree_Species_Dataset/ (after initial setup)

Subfolders within Tree_Species_Dataset correspond to different tree species, with images for each species located inside.

Example:

Tree_Species_Dataset/
├── SpeciesA/
│   ├── image1.jpg
│   └── image2.png
├── SpeciesB/
│   ├── image3.jpeg
│   └── image4.jpg
└── ...
Number of Classes: [X] (e.g., 10, 20, etc.)

Number of Images: [Y] (e.g., 5000, 10000, etc.)

Image Resolution: [Z] (e.g., mixed, standardized to 224x224 during preprocessing)
